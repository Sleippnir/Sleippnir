# Automated Invoice Processing Pipeline (GCP & Document AI)

## 1. Executive Summary

This project showcases the end-to-end design and implementation plan for a serverless, event-driven invoice processing pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). [cite_start]The solution was architected to solve a critical business problem: the time-consuming, error-prone, and costly manual processing of vendor invoices[cite: 5].

[cite_start]By leveraging **Google Document AI** at the core, the system automates the entire lifecycle from ingestion via email to data extraction, validation, and final routing to ERP and analytics systems[cite: 7, 10]. [cite_start]This approach eliminates manual data entry, dramatically reduces payment cycle times, and creates a fully auditable, searchable digital archive of all invoices[cite: 8].

-   [cite_start]**Business Problem**: Manual invoice processing was slow, expensive, and error-prone, leading to delayed payments and a lack of real-time financial data[cite: 5].
-   [cite_start]**My Solution**: An automated, "Document AI First" serverless pipeline on GCP that ingests, interprets, validates, and routes invoice data with minimal human intervention[cite: 10, 18].
-   [cite_start]**Core Impact**: The system was projected to reduce monthly processing effort by **~95%** (from 333 hours to 17 hours) and establish a 90% straight-through processing rate, freeing up significant resources and enabling strategic financial benefits[cite: 265, 267].

## 2. Key Outcomes & Business Value (Conservative Projections)

The following metrics were established to measure the success and return on investment for this initiative.

| Category | KPI | Target Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Efficiency** | Man-Hours Saved per Month | [cite_start]**~316 hours** (a 95% reduction) [cite: 267] |
| **Efficiency** | Average Processing Time | [cite_start]**< 1 hour** (from email receipt to ERP entry) [cite: 282] |
| **Accuracy** | Straight-Through Processing (STP) Rate | [cite_start]**> 90%** (zero human intervention) [cite: 282] |
| **Business Value** | Data Availability for Analytics | [cite_start]**< 2 hours** (for real-time spend analysis) [cite: 282] |
| **Scalability** | Cost Avoidance | [cite_start]Scales to handle 2-3x volume with negligible cost increase, avoiding future headcount[cite: 277]. |

## 3. Technical Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a modular, event-driven pipeline using managed GCP services to ensure scalability, resilience, and low operational overhead.

**Core Pipeline Stages:**
1.  [cite_start]**Ingestion**: A Cloud Function, triggered by Pub/Sub notifications from Gmail, saves invoice PDF attachments to a raw Cloud Storage bucket[cite: 52, 53, 54, 55].
2.  [cite_start]**Extraction**: Document AI's Invoice Processor automatically reads the PDF and extracts key-value pairs (Vendor, Invoice ID, Totals, Line Items) into a structured format[cite: 62, 63].
3.  [cite_start]**Validation & Enrichment**: The extracted vendor name is cross-referenced against an approved vendor list in Firestore to append an internal ERP ID[cite: 16, 17, 71].
4.  [cite_start]**Orchestration & Routing**: A Cloud Workflow orchestrates the final steps: renaming and archiving the PDF, and sending structured data to BigQuery for analytics and the ERP system for payment[cite: 19, 81, 82].
5.  [cite_start]**Exception Handling**: Invoices that fail validation (e.g., a new, unrecognized vendor) are automatically routed to a human review queue, creating a self-improving feedback loop[cite: 21, 22, 29].
