# Project Briefing: Automated Invoice Processing

This document outlines the business case, projected return on investment (ROI), and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the automated invoice processing initiative.

## 1. The Problem

Our organization receives a high volume of invoices from vendors, primarily as PDF attachments via email. Each invoice is structured differently, making manual data entry into our accounting systems a slow, repetitive, and expensive process that is highly susceptible to human error. This inefficiency leads to delayed payments, missed opportunities for early payment discounts, and a lack of real-time visibility into company spending.

## 2. Project Goals

The primary goal is to create a fully automated, "hands-off" system that can:

1.  **Ingest** invoices directly from email attachments.
2.  **Accurately Extract** critical information like vendor name, invoice ID, total amount, and line items.
3.  **Validate** the vendor against our internal records.
4.  **Route** the extracted data to our accounting/ERP system for payment and a data warehouse for analytics.
5.  **Archive** the original invoice PDF in a permanent, searchable repository.

The key business objectives are to eliminate manual effort, significantly reduce payment cycle times, improve data accuracy, and provide an auditable trail for every invoice.

## 3. Projected ROI & Business Impact (Conservative Estimate)

This financial model is based on conservative assumptions to establish a reliable baseline for the project's value.

**Assumptions:**

* **Invoice Volume**: 2,000 invoices per month.
* **Manual Processing Time**: An average of 10 minutes per invoice.
* **Automation Target**: 90% of invoices processed with zero human touch (Straight-Through Processing).
* **Exception Handling Time**: 5 minutes per invoice for the 10% requiring manual review.

| Metric                      | Current State (Manual)      | Future State (Automated)          |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Invoices Processed Manually | 2,000 / month               | 200 / month (10% exceptions)      |
| Total Hours Spent / Month   | **~333 hours** | **~17 hours** |
| **Annual Man-Hours Saved** |                             | **~3,792 hours** |

**Strategic Value (Upside Potential):**
This model does not quantify the significant financial upside from capturing early payment discounts, avoiding late fees, and the strategic value of real-time spend data for financial planning. Furthermore, the system is built to scale, allowing the business to grow its transaction volume without a proportional increase in administrative headcount.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Success

To measure the ongoing effectiveness of the pipeline, the following KPIs will be tracked.

| Category         | KPI                               | Definition                                                                    | Target Goal                                 |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Efficiency** | Cost Per Invoice Processed        | Total monthly GCP costs + (human review hours * hourly rate) / total invoices. | 80% reduction vs. fully-loaded manual cost. |
|                  | Average Processing Time           | The average time from email receipt to successful ERP entry.                  | < 1 hour.                                   |
| **Accuracy** | Straight-Through Processing (STP) Rate | The percentage of invoices processed with zero human intervention.            | > 90%                                       |
|                  | First-Pass Yield                  | The percentage of invoices correctly processed on the first attempt.          | > 95%                                       |
| **Business Value** | Early Payment Discounts Captured  | The total dollar value of early payment discounts successfully captured.      | Increase by 50% YoY.                        |
|                  | Data Availability for Analytics   | Time from invoice receipt to data being available in BigQuery.                | < 2 hours.                                  |
