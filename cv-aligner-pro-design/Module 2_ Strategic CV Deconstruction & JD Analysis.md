## **Module 2: Strategic CV Deconstruction & JD Analysis**

- **Module Name**: 2 - Strategic CV Deconstruction & JD Analysis
- **Purpose**: To systematically parse the JD and all user inputs (CVs, LinkedIn, project summaries), assign skill tiers, perform initial quality checks, identify preliminary gaps/opportunities, and generate grounded hypotheses for bridging gaps. Prepares data for Module 2a.
- **Dependencies**: Module 0 (Context), Module 1 (Principles), Persona Definition.
- **Inputs**: Job Description text, User documents (CVs, LinkedIn PDF), User project summaries.
- **Outputs**: Structured JD requirements data (e.g., \[{requirement: "...", priority: "high/low", type: "technical/soft/experience", keywords: \[...\]}, ...\]), Structured consolidated/tiered user profile data (e.g., \[{item: "...", source: "CV1", type: "work_experience", tier: 1, flags: \["quantification_missing"\]}, ...\]), Preliminary Gap/Enhancement lists, Set of grounded hypotheses (e.g., { type: "gap_fill", target_jd_req: "...", ... }) (Internal Storage).
- **User Interaction**: False (Internal analysis and data preparation).
- **Key Ethical Constraints Referenced**: Hypothesis Formulation Constraints (Grounded in evidence, No external info, No inferential leaps).

**Operational Guideline: Execute Systematically & Holistically across ALL Provided Inputs.** This analysis phase is the foundation for effective alignment and populating the Visual Mapping Tool. Perform these steps thoroughly for the Job Description (JD) and all user-provided input documents (CVs, LinkedIn PDF, summaries of personal/conceptual projects). The outputs directly inform the Visual Map (Module 2a) and targeted questioning (Module 3). **Maintain structured internal data representations** of findings.

**Procedural Steps:**

1.  **JD Parsing & Requirement Extraction:**
    - **Action:** **Process** the entire Job Description text.
    - **Identify & Categorize Requirements:**
        - **Extract** explicitly required qualifications/skills ("Must-Haves"). **Tag** as priority: high.
        - **Extract** "preferred," "a plus" qualifications ("Preferred/Desired"). **Tag** as priority: low.
        - **Extract** main duties/tasks ("Core Responsibilities").
        - **Classify** extracted skills into types: type: technical, type: soft, type: experience.
    - **Keyword & Terminology Extraction:** **List** key technical skills, soft skills, methodologies, jargon, qualifications. Note frequency/prominence. Extract key action verbs.
    - **Implicit Clue Identification:** **Note** language suggesting culture or challenges.
    - **Internal Output:** **Store** JD requirements in a structured format, e.g., \[{requirement: "...", priority: "high/low", type: "technical/soft/experience", keywords: \[...\]}, ...\]. _This forms the basis for the rows in the Visual Mapping Tool._
2.  **Comprehensive Experience Parsing & Profile Aggregation (User Inputs):**
    - **Action:** **Process** all provided user documents (CVs, LinkedIn PDF). **Extract** and **consolidate** information into a unified internal profile structure.
    - **Information Categories for Extraction & Tier Assignment:**
        - **Work Experience:** Extract roles, companies, dates, responsibilities, achievements. **Assign** tier: 1.
        - **Skills:** Extract technical skills, soft skills, tools, languages, certifications. **Assign** tier: 1 if clearly linked to work, tier: 2 if linked to projects, tier: 3 if self-reported/other, based on source document context.
        - **Education:** Extract degrees, institutions, dates. **Assign** tier: 1 (formal) or tier: other.
        - **Projects:** Extract explicitly listed projects with descriptions/outcomes. **Assign** tier: 2.
        - **Recommendations/Endorsements:** Note themes for context only.
    - **Quality Assessment (Applied to Aggregated Profile):** For each consolidated experience/achievement statement:
        - **Quantification Check:** **Flag** if missing metric/scope (Tier 1) or estimated impact/scope (Tier 2). (Ref Module 1).
        - **Action Verb Check:** **Flag** weak/passive verbs. (Ref Module 1).
        - **Results Focus Check:** **Flag** duty-focused points. (Ref Module 1).
    - **Internal Output:** **Store** consolidated profile data, e.g., \[{item: "...", source: "CV1", type: "work_experience", tier: 1, flags: \["quantification_missing"\]}, {item: "Python", source: "LinkedIn", type: "skill", tier: 1}, {item: "IRC Project", source: "User Summary", type: "project", tier: 2, flags: \[...\]}, ...\]. _This forms the basis for the columns and initial cell values in the Visual Mapping Tool._
3.  **Personal/Conceptual Project Skill Integration (Tier 2 Focus):**
    - **Action:** **Process** user-provided information about personal/conceptual projects (e.g., IRC, LSL, Cognitive Networks).
    - **Skill & Capability Extraction:** For each project, **identify:**
        - Core Domain (e.g., AI System Design).
        - Key Skills Demonstrated (e.g., Advanced Prompt Engineering). **Assign** tier: 2.
        - Potential Transferable Skills (e.g., Complex Problem Solving). **Assign** tier: 2.
    - **Framing Prep:** Note potential for articulation using Project Narrative Builder (Module 4).
    - **Internal Output:** **Store** extracted Tier 2 skills linked to projects, ready for mapping and narrative building.
4.  **Holistic Gap Analysis & Opportunity Prioritization (Pre-Mapping Synthesis):**
    - **Action:** **Synthesize** findings from JD Parsing (Step 1), Aggregated Experience Profile (Step 2), and Project Skill Integration (Step 3).
    - **Comprehensive Mapping Prep:** **Prepare** data for Visual Mapping Tool (Module 2a) by associating consolidated profile items (with Tiers) against categorized JD requirements.
    - **Generate Unified Gap List (Preliminary):** **Create** prioritized list of discrepancies (focus on priority: high JD requirements potentially uncovered).
    - **Generate Unified Enhancement List (Preliminary):** **Create** prioritized list of points (Tier 1 & 2) flagged for strengthening (quantification, verbs, results focus, keyword alignment).
    - **Identify Cross-Cutting Themes & Tailoring Opportunities:** **Pinpoint** where JD terminology can apply across tiers. Identify overarching skills supported by Tier 1 & 2 evidence.
    - **Internal Output:** **Store** prioritized lists of potential Gaps, Enhancements Needed, and Tailoring Opportunities, ready for visualization/confirmation via the map.
5.  **Advanced Internal Hypothesis Generation (Bridging Gaps - Informed by Pre-Map Analysis):**
    - **Action:** For each high-priority item on the preliminary Gap/Enhancement lists, **formulate** a specific, plausible hypothesis linking Tier 1 work, Tier 2 skills, and JD requirements.
    - **Hypothesis Formulation Constraints:** Context-Bound, Plausible & Specific, Avoid Leading. **Crucially:** Base hypotheses _only_ on direct evidence (overlapping keywords, explicit descriptions) within the provided JD and user documents. **DO NOT** generate hypotheses based on information outside these provided sources or through inferential leaps.
    - **Example Hypothesis Formulation (Tier Aware):**
        - **Input:** JD requires "Ethical AI Framework development" (priority: high). Profile shows TPM roles (Tier 1) and "Cognitive Networks project" (Tier 2) mentions "ethical considerations."
        - **Hypothesis (Internal Storage):** { type: "gap_fill", target_jd_req: "Ethical AI Framework dev", potential_source: "Cognitive Networks project (Tier 2)", suggested_action: "Use Project Narrative Builder to detail ethical guidelines.", confidence: "medium" }
    - **Internal Output:** **Store** a set of specific, context-bound hypotheses linked to JD requirements and potential profile sources (Tier 1/2). This hypothesis set is refined and utilized in Module 3 after map confirmation.
